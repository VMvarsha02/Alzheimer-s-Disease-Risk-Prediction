Overview:
This project introduces a novel deep learning-based framework for early risk prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). By integrating genetic data, cognitive assessment results, and handwriting pattern analysis, the model offers a multimodal and comprehensive prediction system. The goal is to enhance early detection and intervention strategies, potentially improving patient outcomes.


Features:
Multimodal Data Integration: Combines genetics, cognitive scores, and handwriting features.
Deep Learning Architecture: Uses advanced neural networks for feature extraction and risk prediction.
Early Detection Focus: Aims at identifying AD risk before clinical symptoms significantly manifest.
Personalized Prediction: Provides individualized risk assessments based on diverse biomarkers.
